## System Architecture

### File Structure
```
src/components/teacher/
├── SlidePreviewManager.jsx     # Main preview interface
├── TeacherLessonPreview.jsx    # Interactive lesson renderer

```

### Integration Points
- **Routing**: `/teacher/slides` route in App.jsx
- **Dashboard**: Integrated into TeacherDashboard as a tab
- **Database**: Uses existing teacher service functions
- **Authentication**: Protected by TeacherRoute component

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dark Theme Design
- **Background**: `bg-gray-900` for main areas
- **Sidebar**: `bg-gray-800` with `border-gray-700`
- **Text**: White text throughout
- **Interactive Elements**: Blue accent colors (`bg-blue-600`)

### 3. Notes Management
- **Per-Slide Notes**: Teachers can add notes for each individual slide
- **Auto-Save**: Notes are automatically saved to the database
- **Visual Indicators**: Yellow dots show which slides have notes
- **Database Integration**: Uses `saveTeacherNotes` and `getTeacherNotesForLesson`

### 4. User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear slide selection and preview
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for failed operations

## Technical Implementation

### Database Functions Used
```javascript
// From teacher-service.jsx
import { 
  saveTeacherNotes, 
  getTeacherNotesForLesson 
} from '../../firebase/teacher-service';
```

### State Management
- **Lesson Selection**: Dropdown with all available lessons
- **Slide Navigation**: Current slide index and navigation
- **Notes State**: Local state for current note and all notes
- **Loading States**: Loading and saving indicators

### Component Props
```javascript
// TeacherLessonPreview props
{
  lesson,              // Lesson data object
  currentSlideIndex,   // Current slide index
  onSlideChange,       // Callback for slide changes
  isPreviewMode        // Preview mode flag
}
```

## Files Cleaned Up

### Removed
- `src/components/teacher/SlidePreview.jsx` - Old slide preview component (replaced by TeacherLessonPreview)

3. **Database Changes**: Update teacher-service.jsx functions as needed

## Build Status
