# Firestore Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: 400 Bad Request Errors

You're experiencing 400 Bad Request errors when trying to connect to Firestore. This guide will help you diagnose and fix the issue.

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and look for:
- Detailed error messages in the Console tab
- Network requests in the Network tab
- Any Firebase-related errors

### 2. Use the Diagnostic Tool
A diagnostic component has been added to your app (bottom-right corner in development mode). Click "Test Connection" to get detailed information.

## Common Causes and Solutions

### üî¥ Issue 1: Firestore Database Not Created

**Symptoms:**
- 400 Bad Request errors
- "Database not found" errors
- Connection timeouts

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `israel-cyber-academy`
3. In the left sidebar, click "Firestore Database"
4. Click "Create Database"
5. Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
6. Select a location (choose the closest to your users)
7. Click "Done"

### üî¥ Issue 2: Security Rules Blocking Access

**Symptoms:**
- "Permission denied" errors
- 400 Bad Request with permission-related messages

**Solution:**
1. In Firebase Console, go to Firestore Database
2. Click the "Rules" tab
3. Replace the rules with this development-friendly version:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write test collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** These rules are for development only. For production, use more restrictive rules.

### üî¥ Issue 3: Project Configuration Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Authentication works but Firestore fails
- Inconsistent behavior

**Solution:**
1. Verify your Firebase project settings:
   - Project ID: `israel-cyber-academy`
   - API Key: `AIzaSyC35sH38k9co_R0zBsbDT0S6RE1Cp-ksHE`
   - Auth Domain: `israel-cyber-academy.firebaseapp.com`

2. Check if Firestore is enabled:
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Look for "Firestore Database" in the sidebar
   - If not visible, you need to enable it

### üî¥ Issue 4: Network/Firewall Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Connection timeouts
- Intermittent failures

**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try disabling VPN if you're using one
3. Check if your firewall is blocking Firebase connections
4. Try accessing from a different network

## Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Create Firestore Database
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `israel-cyber-academy`
3. Click "Firestore Database" in sidebar
4. Click "Create Database"
5. Choose "Start in test mode"
6. Select location (e.g., `us-central1`)
7. Click "Done"

### Step 2: Update Security Rules
1. In Firestore Database, click "Rules" tab
2. Replace with the development rules above
3. Click "Publish"

### Step 3: Test Connection
1. Refresh your app
2. Check browser console for new logs
3. Use the diagnostic tool (bottom-right corner)
4. Try logging in with your user account

### Step 4: Verify User Profile Creation
1. After logging in, check if a user profile is created
2. Look for console logs about profile creation
3. Check Firestore Database for a `users` collection

## Production Considerations

When moving to production:
