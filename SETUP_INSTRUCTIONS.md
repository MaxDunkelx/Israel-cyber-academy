# Israel Cyber Campus - Setup Instructions

## Issue Resolution Summary

The 500 Internal Server Error you encountered was caused by two main issues:

1. **File Extension Issue**: The `teacher-service.js` file contained JSDoc type annotations that Vite was interpreting as JSX syntax. This has been resolved by renaming the file to `teacher-service.jsx`.

2. **Missing Firebase Configuration**: The application requires Firebase environment variables that are not currently set up.

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Teacher Service File
- **Problem**: Vite was parsing JSDoc type annotations as JSX in `.js` files
- **Solution**: Renamed `src/firebase/teacher-service.js` to `src/firebase/teacher-service.jsx`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Import References
- **Problem**: Import statements needed to be updated after file rename
- **Solution**: Updated import in `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## 🔧 Required Setup: Firebase Configuration

The application now starts successfully, but you need to set up Firebase to use all features:

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project" or select an existing project
3. Enter project name: `israel-cyber-academy` (or your preferred name)
4. Follow the setup wizard

### Step 2: Enable Firebase Services

1. **Authentication**:
   - Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password"
   - Add your domain to authorized domains:
     - `localhost` (for development)
     - `maxdunkelx.github.io` (for production)

2. **Firestore Database**:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
   - Select a location (choose closest to your users)

### Step 3: Get Firebase Configuration

1. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Click "Add app" > "Web" (</>)
4. Register your app with a nickname
5. Copy the configuration object

### Step 4: Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Step 5: Update Firestore Security Rules

Go to Firestore Database > Rules and use these development rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Current Status

- **Development Server**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5173
- **File Parsing**: ✅ Fixed
- **Firebase Setup**: ⚠️ Required for full functionality

## 🧪 Testing the Application

1. **Without Firebase**: The app will start but show authentication errors
2. **With Firebase**: Full functionality including:
   - User registration/login
   - Progress tracking
   - Teacher dashboard
   - Real-time data sync

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Set up Firebase project following the steps above
2. Create `.env.local` file with your Firebase credentials
3. Restart the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Test user registration and login

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors:

1. **Check Firebase Console**: Ensure services are enabled
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Check `.env.local` file exists and has correct values
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
4. **Check Network Tab**: Look for Firebase API errors

### Common Issues:

- **"Missing environment variables"**: Create `.env.local` file
- **"Permission denied"**: Update Firestore security rules
- **"Database not found"**: Create Firestore database in Firebase Console

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase configuration in the console
3. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly

The application is now properly configured and ready for Firebase integration!
