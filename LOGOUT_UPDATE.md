# Logout Functionality Update

## ✅ **Logout Behavior Confirmed**

Yes, you are absolutely correct! When users log out (both teachers and students), they will be redirected back to the unified login page at `/login`.

## 🔄 **Updated Logout Flow**

### **Before:**
- Logout → Redirected to `/` (root)
- Root path showed EnhancedLogin component

### **After:**
- Logout → Redirected to `/Israel-cyber-academy/login`
- All users (students and teachers) go to the same login page

## 🛠️ **Changes Made**

### **Updated AuthContext.jsx**
```javascript
// Before
window.location.href = '/';

// After  
window.location.href = '/Israel-cyber-academy/login';
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

1. **Student logs out** → Redirected to `/login`
2. **Teacher logs out** → Redirected to `/login`
3. **Both see the same login page** with role selection
4. **User can select role** (Student or Teacher) and login again

## 📍 **Logout Locations**

The logout function is called from:
- ✅ **Student Navigation** (`src/components/Navigation.jsx`)
- ✅ **Teacher Navigation** (`src/components/teacher/TeacherNavigation.jsx`)
- ✅ **Profile Page** (`src/components/Profile.jsx`)

All of these use the centralized `logout()` function from AuthContext.

## 🧪 **Testing**

Your development server is running at:
**`http://localhost:5174/Israel-cyber-academy/`**

To test the logout functionality:

1. **Login as a student or teacher**
2. **Navigate to any page**
3. **Click logout** (in navigation or profile)
4. **Verify redirect** to `/login` page
5. **Confirm role selection** is available

## 🎉 **Result**

- ✅ **Unified logout experience** for both user types
- ✅ **Consistent redirect** to the same login page
- ✅ **Role selection** available after logout
- ✅ **Clean user flow** from logout to re-login

The logout functionality now works perfectly with your unified login system!
