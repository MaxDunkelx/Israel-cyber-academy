```

## 📋 What Backend Developer Needs to Build

### Phase 1: Core API (3-4 weeks)
1. **Authentication System** (JWT-based)
2. **Content Management API** (lessons, slides, CRUD)
3. **User Management API** (profiles, roles, progress)
4. **File Upload System** (images, videos)

### Phase 2: Real-time Features (2-3 weeks)
1. **WebSocket Implementation** (sessions, notifications)
2. **Session Management API** (live sessions)
3. **Student Pool System** (availability tracking)
4. **Real-time Updates** (live collaboration)

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 weeks)
1. **Frontend Integration** (replace Firebase calls)
2. **Testing & Optimization**
3. **Security Implementation**
4. **Deployment Setup**

## 🗄️ Database Requirements

### Core Tables Needed:
- **Users** (authentication, roles, profiles)
- **Lessons** (metadata, content structure)
- **Slides** (content, types, ordering)
- **User Progress** (tracking, analytics)
- **Sessions** (live sessions, participants)
- **Student Pool** (availability, matching)

### Data Volume:
- **Current**: 9 lessons, 200+ slides
- **Expected**: 50+ lessons, 1000+ slides
- **Users**: 1000+ concurrent users
- **Sessions**: 100+ simultaneous live sessions

## 🔐 Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- Role-based access control (student/teacher/system_manager)
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Rate limiting and CORS

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Secure file uploads
- Audit logging

## 📈 Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- API endpoints: < 200ms
- Database queries: < 100ms
- Real-time updates: < 50ms
- File uploads: < 5 seconds

### Scalability
- 1,000+ concurrent users
- 100+ simultaneous live sessions
- 10,000+ API requests per minute

## 🛠️ Technology Recommendations

### Recommended Stack:
```javascript
Backend: Node.js + Express OR Python + FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL + Redis (caching)
Real-time: Socket.io OR WebSockets
Authentication: JWT + bcrypt
File Storage: AWS S3 OR Google Cloud Storage
```
