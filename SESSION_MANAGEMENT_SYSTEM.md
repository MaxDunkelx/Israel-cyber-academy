  status: "active", // "active", "ended"
  currentSlide: 0,
  unlockedSlides: [0, 1, 2], // Slides students can access
  startTime: Timestamp,
  endTime: Timestamp,
  lastActivity: Timestamp,
  connectedStudents: [
    {
      id: "student-uid",
      name: "Student Name",
      joinedAt: Timestamp,
      lastActivity: Timestamp,

## Technical Implementation

### Real-time Synchronization

The system uses Firebase Firestore's real-time listeners to synchronize session state:

```javascript
// Teacher updates slide
await updateSessionSlide(sessionId, newSlideIndex);

// All connected clients receive update
const unsubscribe = listenToSession(sessionId, (updatedSession) => {
  setCurrentSlide(updatedSession.currentSlide);
});
```

### Security Features

- **Role-based Access**: Only teachers can create/host sessions
- **Session Validation**: Students can only join sessions they're enrolled in
- **Slide Access Control**: Students can only access unlocked slides
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track all session activities

### Error Handling

- **Connection Loss**: Automatic reconnection attempts
- **Session Not Found**: Graceful error messages and redirects
- **Permission Errors**: Clear access denied messages
- **Network Issues**: Toast notifications for user feedback
