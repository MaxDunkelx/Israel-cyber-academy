# Login Functionality Testing Guide

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

The login system should work as follows:

### **Student Login:**
1. User visits `/login`
2. User selects "Student" role
3. User enters student credentials
4. User is redirected to `/student/roadmap`

### **Teacher Login:**
1. User visits `/login`
2. User selects "Teacher" role  
3. User enters teacher credentials
4. User is redirected to `/teacher/dashboard`

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Access the Login Page**
- Visit: `http://localhost:5174/Israel-cyber-academy/login`
- You should see the beautiful login page with role selection

### **Step 2: Test Student Login**
1. Click on the **Student card** ("הצטרף כתלמיד")
2. Fill in student credentials:
   - Email: `student@test.com` (or any existing student email)
   - Password: `password123` (or the actual password)
3. Click "התחבר" (Login)
4. **Expected Result**: Redirected to `/student/roadmap`

### **Step 3: Test Teacher Login**
1. Click on the **Teacher card** ("הצטרף כמורה")
2. Fill in teacher credentials:
   - Email: `maxbunnyshow@gmail.com`
   - Password: `M1a2x3d4`
3. Click "התחבר" (Login)
4. **Expected Result**: Redirected to `/teacher/dashboard`

### **Step 4: Test Logout**
1. From either dashboard, click logout
2. **Expected Result**: Redirected back to `/login`

## 🔧 **Creating Test Users**

### **Create Teacher User:**
```bash
npm run create-teacher
```
This creates a teacher with:
- Email: `maxbunnyshow@gmail.com`
- Password: `M1a2x3d4`

### **Create Student User:**
You can create a student user through the signup form on the login page:
1. Go to `/login`
2. Select "Student" role
3. Click "צור חשבון" (Create Account)
4. Fill in the form
5. Submit

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Login Flow:**
1. **EnhancedLogin.jsx** handles form submission
2. **AuthContext.jsx** authenticates with Firebase
3. **App.jsx** routing logic determines redirect based on user role:
   ```javascript
   // In App.jsx - /login route
   element={
     currentUser ? 
       (role === 'teacher' ? 
         <Navigate to="/teacher/dashboard" replace /> : 
         <Navigate to="/student/roadmap" replace />
       ) : 
       <EnhancedLogin />
   }
   ```

### **Role-Based Routing:**
- **Students** → `/student/roadmap`
- **Teachers** → `/teacher/dashboard`
- **Unauthenticated** → `/login`

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If login doesn't redirect correctly:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firebase authentication is working
3. Check that user role is set correctly in Firestore
4. Ensure routing logic in App.jsx is correct

### **If you can't access teacher dashboard:**
1. Run the teacher creation script
2. Verify the user has `role: 'teacher'` in Firestore
3. Check that teacher permissions are granted

### **If you can't access student roadmap:**
1. Verify the user has `role: 'student'` in Firestore
2. Check that student progress is initialized

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

- ✅ Students can login and access `/student/roadmap`
- ✅ Teachers can login and access `/teacher/dashboard`
- ✅ Logout redirects both user types to `/login`
- ✅ Role selection works on the login page
- ✅ Authentication state is maintained correctly
- ✅ Protected routes work for both user types

## 🎉 **Expected URLs**

- **Login Page**: `http://localhost:5174/Israel-cyber-academy/login`
- **Student Dashboard**: `http://localhost:5174/Israel-cyber-academy/student/roadmap`
- **Teacher Dashboard**: `http://localhost:5174/Israel-cyber-academy/teacher/dashboard`
